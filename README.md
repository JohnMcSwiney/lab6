This lab is unfinshed - I'm submitting for partial marks

The program reads for the database, creates objects and displays them on screen. 
It can ge the selected objects info for editing but not much else past that

It's can't:
           add new users to database
           update existing users in database
           save changes to database
           
Sorry I didn't finish this!
